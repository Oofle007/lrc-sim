This script is a simulator for the game "Left, Right, Center". Everyone starts with a certain amount of starting money "money_per_player". When it's your turn, you roll 3 dice if you have 3 or more dollars, or else you roll dice for how much money your have. The dice has 6 sides with 6 options: 3 keep, 1 center, 1 left, and 1 right. If you roll a keep, you keep $1. If you have the last dollar, you win that game. If you roll a center, you put $1 in the center. If you are the last person with money, you win that game. If you roll a right, you give the person to your right $1. If you roll a left, you give the person to your left $1. When the simulation is running, it will give you the percentage of games it has done and the time left in the simulation. When the simulation is done, it will give you the average rolls per game, maximum roll game, minimum roll game, and the average time taken each game (taking into account the "seconds_per_roll" parameter. You can also put in the names of the players in the game, so you can see who won the most.
